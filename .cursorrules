# AI Coding Standards - Cursor Rules

**CRITICAL: You MUST read and follow the AI coding standards at the start of every session.**

## Required Reading

Before starting any work, you MUST read these files in order:

1. **`README-AI-CODING-STANDARDS.md`** - Complete AI coding standards
   - Git operations policy (NEVER commit without showing commit message first)
   - File creation rules
   - Code quality standards
   - Security policies

2. **`docs/ai-standards/AI_STANDARDS_VIOLATIONS_LOG.md`** - Historical violations and lessons learned
   - Review recent violations to understand common mistakes
   - Learn from past errors
   - Understand prevention measures

## Most Critical Rules (Quick Reference)

After reading the full standards, remember these are the most frequently violated:

1. **Git Commits:** NEVER commit immediately when user says "commit". ALWAYS show commit message FIRST, then wait for confirmation.

2. **File Creation:** "Review X" means provide review in conversation, NOT create a review document file. Only create documentation files when explicitly requested.

3. **Code Quality:** No trailing whitespace, files must end with newline, remove backup files.

4. **Security:** NEVER commit sensitive data (API keys, tokens, passwords, etc.)

## Protocol for Commits

**CRITICAL: Two-Step Process (MANDATORY)**

When user says "commit", interpret it as "show me what will be committed" - NOT as "go ahead and commit".

**Step 1 - Show Info, Then STOP:**
1. Show the exact commit message
2. Show all files that will be committed
3. Show diff/stat for each file
4. **END YOUR RESPONSE** - Do NOT commit yet
5. Ask "Should I proceed with this commit?"

**Step 2 - Wait for Confirmation:**
6. Wait for user's NEXT message (separate from "commit" request)
7. User must explicitly confirm (not just "commit" again)
8. **THEN commit in a NEW response**

**CRITICAL RULE:** NEVER commit in the same response where you show the commit message. The commit must happen in a SEPARATE response after user confirms.

## Full Details

See `README-AI-CODING-STANDARDS.md` for complete standards and `docs/ai-standards/AI_STANDARDS_VIOLATIONS_LOG.md` for violation history.

**Remember: Read the full standards documents at the start of every session. They contain critical rules that must be followed.**
