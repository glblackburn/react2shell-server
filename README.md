# React Hello World Server

**Purpose: Security Testing Project**

This project provides a React application with easily switchable React versions, including **vulnerable versions** for security scanner testing. The primary purpose is to enable security scanners and testing tools to detect and validate detection of the React Server Components security vulnerability (CVE).

A React application with a backend server that displays a big red button. When clicked, the button sends a request to the server, which responds with "Hello World!". This simple application serves as a testbed for security scanners to identify vulnerable React versions.

## Purpose

This project is designed to provide **scannable vulnerable React versions** for security testing purposes. It allows security scanners and testing tools to:

- Detect vulnerable React versions in a controlled environment
- Validate that security scanners correctly identify the React Server Components vulnerability
- Test scanner accuracy by switching between vulnerable and fixed versions
- Provide a reproducible test environment for security research

**⚠️ WARNING: This project intentionally includes vulnerable React versions. Do NOT use in production environments.**

## Security Vulnerability

**CVE Reference:** [React Security Advisory - Critical Security Vulnerability in React Server Components](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components)

The vulnerability affects React Server Components in the following versions:
- React 19.0
- React 19.1.0

- Support for testing React Server Components security vulnerability (CVE)

## React Version Switching

This project supports easy switching between different React versions using a Makefile.

### Available React Versions

**Vulnerable Versions (for security testing):**
- React 19.0 ⚠️ VULNERABLE
- React 19.1.0 ⚠️ VULNERABLE
- React 19.1.1 ⚠️ VULNERABLE
- React 19.2.0 ⚠️ VULNERABLE

**Fixed Versions:**
- React 19.0.1 ✅ FIXED
- React 19.1.2 ✅ FIXED
- React 19.2.1 ✅ FIXED

> **Security Note:** Versions 19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0 contain a critical security vulnerability in React Server Components. This project supports these versions for security scanner testing purposes.

### Makefile Commands

```bash
# Switch to vulnerable versions (for security testing)
make vulnerable      # Switch to React 19.0 (VULNERABLE) - quick option
make react-19.0      # Switch to React 19.0 (VULNERABLE)
make react-19.1.0    # Switch to React 19.1.0 (VULNERABLE)
make react-19.1.1    # Switch to React 19.1.1 (VULNERABLE)
make react-19.2.0    # Switch to React 19.2.0 (VULNERABLE)

# Switch to fixed versions
make react-19.0.1    # Switch to React 19.0.1 (FIXED)
make react-19.1.2    # Switch to React 19.1.2 (FIXED)
make react-19.2.1    # Switch to React 19.2.1 (FIXED)

# Check current React version
make current-version

# Install dependencies for current version
make install

# Clean node_modules and package-lock.json
make clean

# Show help
make help
```

## Security Scanner Testing

To test your security scanner against vulnerable React versions:

1. **Switch to a vulnerable version:**
   ```bash
   make react-19.2.0  # or any other vulnerable version
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev      # Terminal 1
   npm run server   # Terminal 2
   ```

3. **Run your security scanner** against the application

4. **Switch to a fixed version** to verify scanner detects the difference:
   ```bash
   make react-19.2.1  # FIXED version
   ```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or navigate to the project directory

2. **Switch to your desired React version** (for security testing, use a vulnerable version):
   ```bash
   make react-19.0
   ```
   Or choose any other version:
   ```bash
   make react-19.1.0
   make react-19.1.1
   make react-19.2.0
   ```

3. **Verify the React version**:
   ```bash
   make current-version
   ```

## Development

### Development Mode (with hot reload)

1. **Start the Vite dev server** (runs on port 5173):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **In a separate terminal, start the Express server** (runs on port 3000):
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:5173`

The Vite dev server is configured to proxy API requests to the Express server.

### Production Mode

1. **Build the React app**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

   Or use the combined command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoint

- **GET /api/hello**
  - Returns: `{ "message": "Hello World!" }`

## Switching React Versions

To switch React versions during development:

1. **Stop any running servers**

2. **Switch to the desired version**:
   ```bash
   make react-19.2.0
   ```

3. **Verify the switch**:
   ```bash
   make current-version
   ```

4. **Restart your development servers**

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm
- make (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux)

## Troubleshooting

### If `make` command is not found

On Windows, you may need to use WSL or install make. Alternatively, you can manually update `package.json` and run `npm install`.

### If dependencies fail to install

Try cleaning and reinstalling:
```bash
make clean
make install
```

### Port already in use

If port 3000 or 5173 is already in use, you can:
- Change the port in `server.js` (PORT environment variable)
- Change the port in `vite.config.js` (server.port)
